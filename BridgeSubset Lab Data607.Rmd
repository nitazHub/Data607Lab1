**Data**
[link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pittsburgh+Bridges)

**Step 1**
Copy Bridge Data url to url variable for use in read.csv command:
```{r bridge_url, message = FALSE}
bridge_url <- "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/bridges/bridges.data.version2"
```

**Step 2**

Create column names vector to use in read.csv command:
```{r columns}
bridge_col_names <- c("ID", "River", "Location", "Erected", "Purpose", "Length", "Lanes", "Clear", "T-or-D", "Material", "Span", "Rel-L", "Type")
```

**Step3***

Create Bridge DataFrame by using read.csv to read bridge data and display 6 rows using head function:
```{r}
bridge_df <- read.csv(bridge_url, header = FALSE, sep = ",", 
                      col.names = bridge_col_names)
head(bridge_df)
```

**Step 4**

Create a subset of bridge data dsplaying selected columns and display 6 rows using head function:
```{r}
sub_bridge_df <- subset(bridge_df, select = c("Purpose", "Length", "Lanes", "Type"))

head(sub_bridge_df)
```
